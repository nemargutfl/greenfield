-------
### Description

This project depicts a map of the Greenfield Lake Park Trail and four marked points of interest. Information on the names of interest points can be observed by hovering over them with the mouse. The 'About This Map' section in the bottom left provides basic information on the trail and map. This project was made using HTML, JavaScript, and a GEOJson file. The basemap was retrieved from Leaflet providers. Google maps and geojson.io were used to collect the linestring and data points.
